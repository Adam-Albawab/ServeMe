# ServeMe-System
A web application designed for a gig-based service request system where service providers could sign up and advertise services ranging from plumbing to tutoring. Customers could then browse the available services from a multitude of categories and request a given service. The system was implemented through the Flask framework with CSS/HTMl for the frontend and Flask/SQLAlchemy for the backend.

## Motivation
The web application was created as a part of the Object Oriented Software Engineering Class at the Unversity of Texas at Arlington. The class was designed to teach the study of the agile unified methodology and its application to object-oriented software development. Topics included requirements acquisition, use case derivation, modeling and design of interaction behavior and state behavior, introduction to design patterns, derivation of design class diagrams, implementation considerations, and deployment.
